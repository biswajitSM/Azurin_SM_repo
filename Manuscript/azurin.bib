	abstract = "The azurin-encoding azu gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A purification procedure was developed to isolate the azurin obtained from the E. coli cells. No differences were observed between azurins isolated from P. aeruginosa and E. coli. A non-reconstitutable azurin-like protein, azurin*, with a spectral ratio (A625/A280) less than 0.01 could be separated from holo-azurin with a spectral ratio of 0.58 (+/- 0.01). The properties of azurin* were examined by electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE and IEF) and spectroscopic (UV/vis, 1H-NMR, static and dynamic fluorescence) techniques, and compared to the properties of holo-azurin and apo-azurin. Azurin* resembles apo-azurin (same pKa* values of His-35 and His-117, same fluorescence characteristics). However, it has lost the ability to bind Cu-ions. It is tentatively concluded that azurin* is a chemically modified form of azurin, the modification possibly being due to oxidation of the ligand residue Cys-112 or the formation of a chemical bond between the ligand residues Cys-112 and His-117. In agreement with previous results from Hutnik and Szabo (Biochemistry (1989) 28, 3923-3934), fluorescence experiments show that the heterogeneous fluorescence decay observed for holo-azurin is not due to the presence of azurin*, but most likely originates from conformational heterogeneity of the holo-azurin.",

	abstract = "Fluorescent protein labeling has been an indispensable tool in many applications of biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological research. Although detailed information about the labeling stoichiometry and exact location of the label is often not necessary, for other purposes, this information is crucial. We have studied the potential of top-down electrospray ionization (ESI)-15T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry to study the degree and positioning of fluorescent labeling. For this purpose, we have labeled the Cu-protein azurin with the fluorescent label ATTO 655-N-hydroxysuccinimide(NHS)-ester and fractionated the sample using anion exchange chromatography. Subsequently, individual fractions were analyzed by ESI-15T FTICR to determine the labeling stoichiometry, followed by top-down MS fragmentation, to locate the position of the label. Results showed that, upon labeling with ATTO 655-NHS, multiple different species of either singly or doubly labeled azurin were formed. Top-down fragmentation of different species, either with or without the copper, resulted in a sequence coverage of approximately 50\%. Different primary amine groups were found to be (potential) labeling sites, and Lys-122 was identified as the major labeling attachment site. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that anion exchange chromatography in combination with ultrahigh resolution 15T ESI-FTICR top-down mass spectrometry is a valuable tool for measuring fluorescent labeling efficiency and specificity.",
