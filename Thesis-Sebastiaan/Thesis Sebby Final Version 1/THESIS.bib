@article{Tabares2014,
abstract = {Nature utilizes oxido-reductases to cater to the energy demands of most biochemical processes in respiratory species. Oxido-reductases are capable of meeting this challenge by utilizing redox active sites, often containing transition metal ions, which facilitate movement and relocation of electrons/protons to create a potential gradient that is used to energize redox reactions. There has been a consistent struggle by researchers to estimate the electron transfer rate constants in physiologically relevant processes. This review provides a brief background on the measurements of electron transfer rates in biological molecules, in particular Cu-containing enzymes, and highlights the recent advances in monitoring these electron transfer events at the single molecule level or better to say, at the individual event level.},

@article{Ciobanu2006,
abstract = {Direct electrochemistry studies on Photosystem I (PSI) were performed using cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry. PSI centers stabilized in aqueous solution by Triton X-100 surfactant were adsorbed on hydroxyl-terminated hexanethiol modified gold electrodes. We have identified the electron donor, P700, and the electron acceptor sites, F A /F B , based on the previously reported preferred orientation for P700 on hydroxyl-terminated self-assembled monolayers. The reported potential values (E P700 = +0.51 V vs. NHE; E FA/FB = {\`{A}}0.36 V vs. NHE) correlate very well with the established literature for P700, while the weaker signal for F A /F B lies within previous literature values. We were able to identify both redox centers on the same voltammogram. The P700 center clearly shows revers-ible electrochemical behavior. The expected F A /F B reduction is small in comparison, reflecting the dominant orientation of PSI with the F A /F B centers farther away and the P700 center nearer the electrode surface. As a molecular diode, PSI does not permit reverse direction conductivity to the F B so the small F A /F B peaks reflect other orientations besides the predominant one. PSI adsorbed on a hydroxyl-ter-minated hexanethiol modified gold substrate displays a photoenhanced reduction current for the P700 + center in the presence of light and an electron acceptor, methyl viologen. This photoelectrochemical response demonstrates protein functionality after adsorption.},

@article{And2004,
abstract = {We present a method for the analysis of optical single molecule emission data that exhibit discrete intensity jumps. This new method uses a generalized likelihood ratio test that determines the location of an intensity change point based on individual photon arrival times. This test is applied recursively to an entire single molecule intensity trajectory, thus finding each change points. Expectation−maximization clustering and the Bayesian information criterion is then used for accurate determination of the true number of states accessible to the system. This procedure allows rigorous and quantitative determination of intensity change points without the artificial time resolution limitations that arise from binning and thresholding.},

@article{Vosch2007,
abstract = {The water-soluble, near-IR-emitting DNA-encapsulated silver nanocluster presented herein exhibits extremely bright and photostable emission on the single-molecule and bulk levels. The photophysics have been elucidated by intensity-dependent correlation analysis and suggest a heavy atom effect of silver that rapidly depopulates an excited dark level before quenching by oxygen, thereby conferring great photostability, very high single-molecule emission rates, and essentially no blinking on experimentally relevant time scales (0.1 to {\textgreater}1,000 ms). Strong antibunching is observed from these biocompatible species, which emit {\textgreater}10(9) photons before photobleaching. The significant dark-state quantum yield even enables bunching from the emissive state to be observed as a dip in the autocorrelation curve with only a single detector as the dark state precludes emission from the emissive level. These species represent significant improvements over existing dyes, and the nonpower law blinking kinetics suggest that these very small species may be alternatives to much larger and strongly intermittent semiconductor quantum dots.},

@article{Shinwari2010,
abstract = {Over the past two decades, there has been an increasing trend towards miniaturization of both biological and chemical sensors and their integration with miniaturized sample pre-processing and analysis systems. These miniaturized lab-on-chip devices have several functional advantages including low cost, their ability to analyze smaller samples, faster analysis time, suitability for automation, and increased reliability and repeatability. Electrical based sensing methods that transduce biological or chemical signals into the electrical domain are a dominant part of the lab-on-chip devices. A vital part of any electrochemical sensing system is the reference electrode, which is a probe that is capable of measuring the potential on the solution side of an electrochemical interface. Research on miniaturization of this crucial component and analysis of the parameters that affect its performance, stability and lifetime, is sparse. In this paper, we present the basic electrochemistry and thermodynamics of these reference electrodes and illustrate the uses of reference electrodes in electrochemical and biological measurements. Different electrochemical systems that are used as reference electrodes will be presented, and an overview of some contemporary advances in electrode miniaturization and their performance will be provided.},

abstract = {TWO RESEARCH TEAMS recently reported new ways to modify the properties of the copper-based electron-transfer protein azurin: replacing residues to change the oxidation-reduction (redox) potential in a controllable way, and modifying the copper center to enhance reactivity. The approaches might make it easier to adapt azurin and similar proteins for applications in artificial photosynthesis or in fuel cells for motor vehicles. Redox processes power various biological and chemical phenomena ranging from photosynthesis and respiration to industrial catalysis and fuel cells. In nature, such processes are mediated by redox-active proteins such as azurin, a member of the cupredoxin family. Just as a variety of batteries are needed to power different electronic devices, proteins with varied redox potentials are needed to drive different biological processes. Scientists would like to modify such proteins in a controlled way to exploit them in redox processes. But engineering redox proteins hasn't been easy becaus...},

abstract = {Single-molecule enzymology provides an unprecedented level of detail about aspects of enzyme mechanisms which have been very difficult to probe in bulk. One such aspect is intramolecular electron transfer (ET), which is a recurring theme in the research on oxidoreductases containing multiple redox-active sites. We measure the intramolecular ET rates between the copper centers of the small laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor at room temperature and pH 7.4, one molecule at a time, during turnover. The forward and backward rates across many molecules follow a log-normal distribution with means of 460 and 85 s(-1), respectively, corresponding to activation energies of 347 and 390 meV for the forward and backward rates. The driving force and the reorganization energy amount to 0.043 and 1.5 eV, respectively. The spread in rates corresponds to a spread of ∼30 meV in the activation energy. The second-order rate constant for reduction of the T1 site amounts to 2.9 × 10(4) M(-1) s(-1). The mean of the distribution of forward ET rates is higher than the turnover rate from ensemble steady-state measurements and, thus, is not rate limiting.},

@article{Warren2010,
abstract = {Ascorbate (vitamin C) is a ubiquitous biological cofactor. While its aqueous solution chemistry has long been studied, many in vivo reactions of ascorbate occur in enzyme active sites or at membrane interfaces, which have varying local environments. This report shows that the rate and driving force of oxidations of two ascorbate derivatives by the TEMPO radical (2,2',6,6'-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl) in acetonitrile are very sensitive to the presence of various additives. These reactions proceed by the transfer of a proton and an electron (a hydrogen atom), as is typical of biological ascorbate reactions. The measured rate and equilibrium constants vary substantially with added water or other polar solutes in acetonitrile solutions, indicating large shifts in the reducing power of ascorbate. The correlation of rate and equilibrium constants indicates that this effect has a thermochemical origin rather than being a purely kinetic effect. This contrasts with previous examples of solvent effects on hydrogen atom transfer reactions. Potential biological implications of this apparently unique effect are discussed.},
